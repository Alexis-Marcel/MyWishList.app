# MyWishList.app

#######     This project was carried out as part of the web/server programming module of the Nancy computer science diploma.        ########

It consists in creating a web application allowing to create lists of gifts that can be reserved to offer.


Project setup : 


• This project was made in php, so you need to install the php package at the following link: https://www.php.net/ , and then add the download folder to the PATH.

• The project uses Composer. To start, you need to install composer at this address : https://getcomposer.org/

• Then use the following command in the terminal at the root of the project: composer install

• Finally you can host the project with a local host such as XAMPP : https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html

• For the proper functioning of the application you must create the corresponding database. You can do this easily with the wish_bdd.sql file that you just have to import.
